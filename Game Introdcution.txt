the first one does not work on your mac laptop.

open a terminal, and type:
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:Location_of_your_CLASS_PATH file
then go to the file KimiToAri
type:
javac AriSnakeGame/ucsdKWang/SnakeControllerEC.java
java AriSnakeGame.ucsdKWang.SnakeControllerEC 800 200 900 

here, the last three integer can be changed. The first number must be between
500 to 800 inclusively, which indicates the size of the whole canvas. The 
second integer must be a positive integer from 20 to 400 and this number
must be evenly divided by the first input. The last number will be an integer 
from 200 to 1000. Make sure that the difficulty of teh game will increase if 
you decrease the value of input of the last argument.
